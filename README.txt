Spec::Ui
========

Spec::Ui is an add-on to RSpec that lets you use a UI-testing framework
such as Selenium or Watir/Safariwatir from RSpec. Spec::Ui also makes it
easy to create HTML reports with screenshots as described in this blogpost:

As much as possible of the supporting code has been factored out to separate files
under Spec::Ui, and the distribution contains examples with a spec_helper and a Rakefile
that you can copy into your own project and tweak if needed.
